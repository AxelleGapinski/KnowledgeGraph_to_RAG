Peter Albert David Singer was born on July 6, 1946, in Melbourne, Australia, to Austrian-Jewish parents who had fled Nazi-occupied Vienna in 1938. His parents, Cora and Ernest Singer, left behind a large family, many of whom perished in the Holocaust. This historical and personal context played a significant role in shaping Singer’s sensitivity to issues of suffering, justice, and the moral consideration of others. He was raised in a secular household and attended Scotch College in Melbourne. Singer later studied law, history, and philosophy at the University of Melbourne, before earning a BPhil in philosophy at the University of Oxford in 1971 under the supervision of R. M. Hare, a utilitarian philosopher who greatly influenced Singer’s ethical outlook.
                Singer is most widely known for his contributions to moral philosophy, particularly in the areas of applied ethics and bioethics. He is a proponent of utilitarianism, a normative ethical theory that evaluates actions based on their consequences for the overall well-being of sentient beings. Singer’s version of utilitarianism is often described as preference utilitarianism, which seeks to maximize the satisfaction of preferences or interests rather than mere happiness or pleasure. This approach places importance on the subjective interests of all beings capable of having preferences, regardless of species, intelligence, or social status. His commitment to this impartial moral framework underpins much of his philosophical and activist work.
                In 1975, Singer published Animal Liberation, a book that is widely credited with launching the modern animal rights movement. In this work, he introduced the concept of speciesism, a term that denotes a biased preference for the interests of one’s own species over those of other species. Singer argued that such bias is morally indefensible, akin to racism or sexism. He proposed that the capacity to suffer, not intelligence or language ability, should be the criterion for moral consideration. Singer maintained that because many animals can feel pain and suffer, their interests should be given equal consideration to those of humans. He advocated for the cessation of practices such as factory farming, animal experimentation, and other forms of institutionalized animal exploitation. While he did not argue that animals should have the same rights as humans, he insisted that their suffering should count equally in moral calculations.
                Singer’s work on animal ethics influenced the rise of vegetarianism and veganism in Western societies and spurred legislative and corporate changes regarding animal welfare. His views are grounded in empirical facts about animal cognition and sentience, and he has continued to revise and update his arguments in light of scientific developments. Despite his influence, Singer has also faced criticism for his utilitarian framework, particularly from those who argue that it leads to counterintuitive conclusions in some scenarios. Nonetheless, his work remains central to academic and activist discourse on animal rights
                In addition to his work on animal ethics, Singer has made significant contributions to bioethics. He has written extensively on issues such as euthanasia, infanticide, embryo research, and global health ethics. In his book Practical Ethics, first published in 1979 and now in its third edition, Singer applies utilitarian reasoning to a wide range of moral dilemmas. One of the most controversial aspects of this book is his argument that under certain circumstances, it may be ethically permissible to end the life of a newborn infant with severe disabilities if doing so would minimize overall suffering. These arguments have drawn both praise and intense criticism, particularly from disability rights advocates, some of whom argue that his reasoning devalues the lives of disabled individuals. Singer’s response is that his conclusions follow from a commitment to reduce suffering and enhance quality of life, and that moral reasoning should be grounded in facts and consequences rather than emotion or tradition.
                Singer is also well known for his work on global poverty and effective altruism. In his 1972 essay “Famine, Affluence, and Morality,” Singer argued that affluent individuals have a moral obligation to help those suffering from extreme poverty if they can do so without sacrificing something of comparable moral importance. He used the example of a child drowning in a shallow pond: if one can save the child at the cost of ruining an expensive pair of shoes, one is morally required to do so. He argued that the same logic applies to donating to aid organizations that can save lives at relatively low cost. This essay laid the foundation for much of the contemporary effective altruism movement, which emphasizes using reason and evidence to do the most good possible with one's resources.
                Singer has continued to be an influential figure in the effective altruism community. His book The Life You Can Save, published in 2009 and updated in a 2019 edition, offers both philosophical arguments and practical recommendations for individuals seeking to contribute to global well-being. The book also spawned a nonprofit organization of the same name, which promotes evidence-based giving and maintains a list of recommended charities. Singer himself donates a significant portion of his income to high-impact charities and encourages others to adopt similar commitments.
                Throughout his career, Singer has taught at several universities, including Monash University in Australia and Princeton University in the United States, where he has been a professor since 1999. At Princeton, he served as the Ira W. DeCamp Professor of Bioethics in the University Center for Human Values. He has also held appointments at the University of Melbourne and other institutions around the world. His academic work spans a wide array of topics, but all are unified by his utilitarian commitment to reducing suffering and promoting well-being.
                Singer has received numerous awards and honors for his contributions to philosophy and public discourse. He was made a Companion of the Order of Australia in 2012 for his work in bioethics and his role in the development of animal rights and effective altruism. Despite widespread admiration, he remains a controversial figure, particularly for his views on life-and-death issues, which some see as overly detached or rationalistic. However, many defenders argue that Singer’s willingness to engage with uncomfortable ethical questions is a strength rather than a flaw, and that his work stimulates necessary debates about the boundaries of moral concern.
                Singer’s legacy is far-reaching. He has transformed public understanding of ethical responsibility by urging individuals to expand their moral circle to include not just their families or communities, but all sentient beings. His influence spans philosophy, animal advocacy, global health, development economics, and philanthropy. Through his writings, teaching, and activism, Peter Singer has reshaped contemporary moral discourse and continues to provoke critical engagement with the most pressing ethical challenges of the modern world.
